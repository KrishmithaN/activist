There are a number of ways that YOU can contribute to providing women with free menstrual products. </p>

<h3> 
1. Sign, Lead and Share Petitions

  Signing petitions is just like voting for a President. Every vote counts. Petitions are a great way to show the state that free menstrual products is a NEED.

2. Donate menstrual and hygiene products
</h3>
    <p style ="text-align:left;">
  Another way you can help is by donating unused and clean menstrual and hygiene products. Menstrual products include tampons, pads, and menstrual cups. Hygiene products include clean underwear, sanitary napkins, and cloth. Reach out to a local womens shelter and see if they take donations. Please remember that if you donate any of these products, make sure they are clean, unused and packed.

    Besides sharing links to others, there are also other ways to get connected with advocating for women's menstruation rights. 
      * Organize menstrual product drives and fundraisers in your community to collect and donate pads and tampons to local shelters and food pantries. 
      * Lead educational workshops in your community about menstruation, sustainable products, and destigmatizing menstruation. 
    Overall, be a leader in your community. If you notice a shortage of menstruation products, take action. Connect with others such as writing letters to those in charge. Make flyers or videos! Spread awareness.

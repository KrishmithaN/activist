    <h3>What is menstruation?</h3>
    <p style ="text-align:left;">Menstruation is a part of a woman's cycle when the lining of the uterus is shed. During each monthly cycle, it prepares itself to have a fetus. When fertilization does not occur, the lining fo the uterus, blood and mucus from the vagina and cervix make up the menstrual flow that leaves the body through the vagina during the period. </p>
    <h3>When does menstruation start?</h3>
    <p style ="text-align:left;">There is no specific age that the menstrual period is supposed to start. The start of the menstrual cycle is impacted by multiple factors such as stress, diet, and exercise. On average, a young woman starts her cycle age the age of 12 to 15 or after there is growth in pubic hair, underarm hair and the breast. </p>
    <h3>How long is a menstrual period?</h3>
    <p style ="text-align:left;">For the first couple of years after getting their period, the length and intensity of a woman's period may vary and be irregular. Once a few years have passed, a normal menstrual period could last up to seven days. However, the blood flow during that time varies on factors such as stress, diet and exercise. </p>
